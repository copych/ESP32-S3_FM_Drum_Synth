# ESP32-S3 FM Drum Synth

A high-performance FM drum synthesizer built for the ESP32-S3.  
Supports multi-operator FM synthesis, realtime MIDI control, patch editing via OLED+encoder UI, and flexible drumkit management.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **6-operator FM synthesis** with 17 routing algorithms (Dexed-inspired)
- ‚úÖ **Custom envelope engine** with hold, fast-release, and block-aware processing
- ‚úÖ **Stereo audio output** via I2S, using normalized float-to-int audio pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Per-note drumkits** with full patch mapping to GM MIDI notes (128-note map)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time MIDI control** (USB or serial), including velocity and retriggers
- ‚úÖ **On-device GUI** via SH1106 OLED + rotary encoder + buttons
- ‚úÖ **Waveform blending**: sine, triangle, square, saw, noise, and inverted variants
- ‚úÖ **Nonlinear SVF filter with drive** per voice
- ‚úÖ **Per-voice reverb send**, globally editable reverb parameters
- ‚úÖ **Optimized DSP math**: fast sine, LUTs, `fast_fabsf`, saturators, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Extremely low latency** voice allocator with note stealing and `MAX_VOICES_PER_NOTE` control
- ‚úÖ **Drumkit save/load** via JSON on SD (or LittleFS, configurable)
- ‚úÖ **Modular architecture**: patching, voice engine, allocator, GUI, and storage are decoupled

Each FmVoice6:
    - 6x FmOperator
    - Flexible routing (17 algorithms)
    - Filter + envelope
    - Reverb send

Each FmOperator:
    - Multiple waveforms
    - Separated fmProcess(), amProcess(), outProcess()
    - Internal feedback
